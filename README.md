# ðŸ§¹ PAN Number Data Cleaning & Validation Project  

---

## ðŸ“– About My Project  
This project is focused on **cleaning and validating Permanent Account Numbers (PANs)** from a dataset.  
PAN is a critical financial identity in India, and ensuring the accuracy of PAN data is important to reduce errors, avoid compliance issues, and prevent fraudulent entries.  

Using **Python (pandas & regex)**, this project automates the data cleaning process and applies strict validation checks to identify **Valid PANs** and **Invalid PANs**.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
The dataset initially contained several issues such as **missing PANs, duplicate records, inconsistent formatting, and invalid patterns**.  

The goal was to:  
- Clean the raw data.  
- Standardize PAN formats.  
- Apply validation logic based on official PAN rules.  
- Categorize each record as **Valid** or **Invalid**.  
- Generate a **summary report** for better understanding.

## ðŸ“¦ Project Requirements  
Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:  

### ðŸ”¹ Programming Language  
- Python 3.8 or above  

### ðŸ”¹ Required Python Packages  
- **pandas** â†’ For data manipulation & cleaning  
- **openpyxl** â†’ For reading/writing Excel files  
- **re (Regex)** â†’ For validating PAN format  

### ðŸ”¹ Install Dependencies  
- **pip install pandas** 
- **pip install openpyxl**
- **pip install re**

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives  
- Remove missing, blank, or duplicate PAN entries.  
- Standardize PAN numbers (trim spaces, convert to uppercase).  
- Validate PANs using strict rules:  
  - Exactly 10 characters long.  
  - Format: **AAAAA1234A** (5 letters, 4 digits, 1 letter).  
  - No adjacent duplicate characters.  
  - No sequential alphabets (ABCDE) or numbers (1234).  
- Categorize PANs as **Valid** or **Invalid**.  
- Generate a **summary report** with total records, valid PANs, invalid PANs, and missing PANs.  

---

## ðŸ“Š Insights from the Project  
- Many PAN entries were **missing or duplicated**, which had to be removed for accuracy.  
- Standardizing text (uppercase, no extra spaces) was essential before applying validation rules.  
- A considerable number of records failed validation due to **incorrect formats or patterns**, showing why automated validation is critical.  

---

## ðŸ”„ Why Data Cleaning & Transformation is Important?  
Raw datasets are often messy â€” with typos, missing values, duplicates, and incorrect formats.  
For PAN numbers, this can mean:  
- **Compliance issues** if invalid PANs are processed.  
- **Fraudulent entries** slipping into financial systems.  
- **Wrong business insights** if inaccurate data is analyzed.  

By cleaning and validating, we ensure that only **trustworthy, standardized, and accurate records** are used.

## ðŸŒŸ STAR Methodology  

### **Situation**  
The dataset of PAN numbers contained errors â€” missing values, duplicates, extra spaces, and invalid formats.  

### **Task**  
To clean and validate the dataset so that only **authentic and valid PANs** remain.  

### **Action**  
- Cleaned data by removing blanks, duplicates, and formatting inconsistencies.  
- Standardized all PANs to a uniform uppercase format.  
- Applied **validation logic** using Python (regex, custom functions).  
- Classified records as **Valid** or **Invalid** and created a summary report.  

### **Result**  
- Produced a **clean dataset** ready for business or compliance use.  
- Clear summary highlighting the distribution of valid vs invalid PANs.  
- Enhanced **data quality, accuracy, and trustworthiness**.

## ðŸ“ˆ Impact of Data Cleaning  
- âœ… **Improved Accuracy**: Only valid PANs are retained.  
- âœ… **Reduced Risks**: Invalid or fraudulent records are removed.  
- âœ… **Reliable Analytics**: Reports and insights are based on accurate data.  
- âœ… **Automation**: Saves significant time compared to manual verification.
